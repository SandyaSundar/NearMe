           Arulmigu Sri Pooludaiyar Sastha Kovil in Marukalthalai near Seevalaperi, Tirunelveli, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Sastha (Pooludaiyar), worshipped with Purna and Pushkala forms. It has many parivara moorthigal (auxiliary deities) such as Sangili Boothadar, Thalavai Madan, Malaiyazhagu Amman and others. Devotees believe that the main idol came into existence during a journey through forests and hills by seven men from Maniyachi, who felt divine protection from Sastha after observing miraculous signs.
